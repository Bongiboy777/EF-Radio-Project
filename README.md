  ### RetroSpective
  <p>
  Sprint was somewhat productive, but was held back by minimal planning of database aspects and general foresight. Could have been managed better but made steady progress. Have clearer idea of upcoming problems and potential solutions regarding database. For next time, plan out the architecture and build a mental user story going through all processes.
