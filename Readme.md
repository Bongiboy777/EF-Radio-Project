## Project Description

#### Task
This project assignment was given as part of the C# SDET programme from Sparta global as the mid-course project. 


At this point we had covered C# Core, OOP, Data, WPF and agile, and the task was to produce a three tier application using the principles learnt previously. The three tiers consist of 

1. A Database layer, holding all relevant tables and relationships, using SQL.
2.  An intermediate/business layer,  using C# and entity framework to communicate with and use the database, as well as any other behind the scenes functionality/architecture needed.
3.  A GUI layer, using WPF to build the frontend of the application.

The application ideas were independently determined, planned and executed by each member of the class, and using the SCRUM framework we divided the project into seven sprints starting on Tuesday 11/05/21 and ending on Tuesday 18/05/21 where we presented our final products in a general meeting in the Sparta Academy.


#### My implementation

<p>
    My goal was to expand on a smaller project started on the course, which was a simple radio/playlist project. The project functions as a playlist creator and music player and was chosen because of my passion for music and already having a good idea of what I wanted it to become. </p>

â€‹    


1. Database layer.
	- Users.
	- Playlists.
	- Tracks.
2. Intermediate/business layer.
	- User manager.
	- Playlist manager.
	- Track manager.
3.  GUI layer.
	- Playback interface.
	- Authentication interface.
	- Playlist management interface.

  ### RetroSpective

  <p>
  Sprint was somewhat productive, but was held back by minimal planning of database aspects and general foresight. Could have been managed better but made steady progress. Have clearer idea of upcoming problems and potential solutions regarding database. For next time, plan out the architecture and build a mental user story going through all processes.
